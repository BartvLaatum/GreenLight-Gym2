# GreenLight-Gym 2.0

This repository is a reimplementation of the state-of-the-art greenhouse model in C++ with bindings for Python.

The model is wrapped in the Gymnasium environment to experiment (reinforcement) learning-based controllers.

Since the downstream model is implemented in CasADi, also *advanced* control techniques like MPC are available.
